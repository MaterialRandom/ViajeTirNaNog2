Introduction
============================================================================

WARNING: This plugin is to be used with RPG Maker MV 1.5.0 or above! This is
because the MV 1.5.0 editor allows for this plugin to be made in an orderly
and efficient manner. Please make sure your RPG Maker MV software is up to
date before using this plugin.

A quest journal is a very important tool provided by game developers for the
players. It lists various quests, missions, and objectives that the player
can pursue in order to progress further into the game. This can be helpful
in reminding the player what needs to be done in the event the player can
forget what things there are to do in a vast and large RPG world.

This plugin places a quest journal system into your RPG Maker MV game. You
can set up how the quest journal appears, move its windows around and/or
reshape them to fit your game. There are 100 quest slots provided by this
plugin (more can be obtained through extension plugins) and each one of them
requires your attention in constructing individually.

You can adjust the quest's title, display a difficulty level, remind the
player who the quest is from, where that quest is from, various dynamic
descriptions explaining the quest, a list of objectives to make, a list of
rewards that will be given to the player once the quest is complete, and any
subtext footnotes you may wish to insert into each quest.

---

Keep in mind that while this plugin does enable a quest journal system into
your game, this plugin will NOT automate it. If you have a quest enabled, it
is still up to you to add the quest properly into the journal, set its many
objectives, when the other objectives appear, what the rewards are, and then
giving out the rewards yourself manually. The purpose of this plugin is to
simply serve as a visual record for your player to see what quests have been
handed down to him or her.

Instructions - Setting Up the Quest List Window
============================================================================

The plugin parameter 'Quest List Window' can be modified to show the various
quest types. By default, the plugin will have the following quest types:
Main Quests, Side Quests, Character Quests, and Tutorial Quests. Here's what
there is to know about the Quest List Window.

---

Show Types
- If this is enabled, it will allow for the Quest List Window to display the
various quest types. If this is disabled, then those quest types will not
appear and all quests will be displayed without their quest type as their
individual header.
Default: true

Type Order
- This is the order for the quest list types and it also enables which types
will be available in the quest journal to display. You can use text codes
here to add icons and/or colors to the quest types. When you are typing out
the quest type names for the individual quest types to fall under, you can
omit the \i[x] and \c[x] codes, but everything else must be in tact.
Default: ["\\c[6]Main Quests","\\c[4]Side Quests","\\c[3]Character Quests",
          "\\c[5]Tutorial Quests"]

List Open Symbol
- The symbol used to display to show a quest type is opened (showing all of
the quests listed under it) and not closed (not showing any of the quests
listed under it).
Default: -

List Closed Symbol
- The symbol used to display to show a quest type is closed (not showing any
of the quests listed under it) and not opened (showing all of the quests
listed under it).
Default: +

Type Text Format
- The text formating type display the quest types in the Quest List Window.
%1 will refer to the Open/Closed Symbol. %2 will be the quest type's name.
%3 will reveal the number of quests that are listed under this quest type.
Default: %1%2 (%3)

Quest Indent
- This is how much to indent the regular quests if quest types are shown.
This is to help players distinguish quest types from regular quests, though
it isn't necessary if you plan on using icons for your quests and none for
your quest types.
Default: 0

Show Empty
- If enabled, this will show quest types that are empty and have no quests
under them. Otherwise, if it is disabled, quest types that have no quests
will not appear in the quest list and can help reduce clutter.
Default: false

- This is how the text appears for the 'Read Quest' command. This command
will only appear in the List Window if an extension plugin prompting the
extra actions list to appear.
Default: \i[121]Read Quest

Cancel
- This is how the text appears for the 'Cancel' command. This command will
only appear in the List Window if an extension plugin prompting the extra
actions list to appear.
Default: \i[16]Cancel

Instructions - Setting Up the Quest Data Window
============================================================================

The plugin parameter 'Quest Data Window' can be modified to show the various
information contained inside of a quest. This data is used by the player to
understand just what is required of the player to do in order to fulfill and
complete the quest. This window's settings can be left as is, but should you
wish to alter it to fit your game, read below:

---

No Data Text
- This is the text to be displayed in the data window when there is no quest
currently selected by the quest list window. You can use text codes here to
make the text appear more vivid to your players.

Default:
Welcome to the \c[4]Quest Journal\c[0].

Here, you can review over the various
quests given to you by people from all
over the world.

Word Wrap Version (Requires YEP_MessageCore.js):
<WordWrap>Welcome to the \c[4]Quest Journal\c[0].
<br>
<br>Here, you can review over the various
quests given to you by people from all
over the world.

Quest Data Format
- This format is how the data in the quest data window is shown to your
players. You can use various text codes to make your quest data window more
vivid to your players. %1 will reference the title without any icons or
color text codes. %2 will reference the quest's difficulty level. %3 will be
who the quest is from. %4 will display where the quest is from. %5 will show
the quest's current description, which can change midway through the quest.
%6 will show the various objectives the player needs to achieve. %7 will
show any rewards the player can earn. And if there are any, %8 will show the
subtext for the quest.

Load Delay
- This is the amount of frames the data window will wait before loading a
quest's data onto the window itself. This is to prevent overburdening the
game engine by loading every single quest that the cursor passes through,
and instead, waits until the cursor has settled on a particular quest entry
for x amount of frames before loading it.
Default: 30

============================================================================
Instructions - Setting Up New Quests
============================================================================

By default, there aren't any quests made for you. You must set each one up
manually. Go into the plugin parameters for YEP_QuestJournal.js and look for
the ---Quest List--- section. Each of those entries starts off empty.
However, if you decide to modify it, you'll be greeted with a template that
explains how to set up your quests. Here is what each parameter does:

---

Title
- This is the title of your quest. It will show up in three places: the
quest list, the quest title window, and if you format it to show in the data
window, it will appear there as well. You can use text codes to change the
color of the quest or to give the quest icons.

Type
- This is the quest type. If you decide to show quest types from the list
window, this will be where this quest will be listed under. The template has
a drop down window for a few of the popular quest types, but you can enter
in your own quest type. Keep in mind that this is case sensitive and will
require you to type out the quest type correctly. You can, however, omit any
\i[x] or \c[x] text codes.

Difficulty
- No mechanical purpose. It's just there to label a certain difficulty level
for the quest. You can insert any kind of text you wish here and it will be
displayed in the quest data window if you decide to keep it in there.

From
- No mechanical purpose. This can be used to state which character in your
game issued this quest so the player can have a reference point in knowing
who to return to when it becomes time to deliver the quest results.

Location
- No mechanical purpose. This can be used to state where the quest has
originated from, and can reduce the amount of effort the player needs to in
order to figure out where the quest came from.

Description
- No mechanical purpose. This is often used to describe the contents of the
quest to the player and provide a set of general instructions as to what the
player has to actually do. You can provide multiple descriptions. However,
only the first description will be visible by default. If you do provide
multiple descriptions, you can change the entry using the plugin command:
'Quest x Change Description Entry To y' to alter the description entry to
display something else midway through a quest.

Objectives List
- No mechanical purpose to the game but does have mechanical aspects. The
objectives list is commonly used to display a specific set of instructions
the player needs to do in order to complete the quest. Multiple sets of
objectives can be displayed to indicate multiple objectives that need to be
fulfilled by the player.

Visible Objectives
- This is a list of the set of objectives that will be visible by default
when the quest is added to the game's quest journal. Each number entry in
there refers to the objective ID (their order position) found in the
'Objectives List' plugin parameter.

Rewards List
- No mechanical purpose to the game but does have mechanical aspects. The
rewards list is to show what the player has to gain as a result of finishing
the quest. Multiple sets of rewards can be displayed to indicate the player
will receive more than just one type of reward.

Visible Rewards
- This is a list of the set of rewards that will be visible by default when
the quest is added to the game's quest journal. Each number entry in there
refers to the reward ID (their order position) found in the 'Rewards List'
plugin parameter.

Subtext
- No mechanical purpose. This is usually used as a footer to provide the
player a message that doesn't fit elsewhere in the data window. You can use
this however you like or don't use it at all. Multiple sets of subtexts can
be used here in case you wish to update the subtext midway through a quest.

============================================================================
Main Menu Manager - Positioning the Quest Journal Command
============================================================================

For those using the Main Menu Manager and would like to position the Quest
command in a place you'd like, use the following format:

      Name: Yanfly.Param.QuestCmdName
    Symbol: quest
      Show: $gameSystem.isShowQuest()
   Enabled: $gameSystem.isEnableQuest()
       Ext:
 Main Bind: this.commandQuest.bind(this)
Actor Bind:

Insert the above setup within a Main Menu Manager slot. Provided you copy
the exact settings to where you need it, it will appear there while using
all of the naming, enabling, disabling, hiding, and showing effects done by
the plugin parameters.

Remember to turn off 'Auto Place Command' from the plugin parameters.

============================================================================
Script Calls
============================================================================

For this plugin, you can use various script calls for certain events to make
checks on a quest's progress. Here are the different event types and the
various script calls you can use with them:

  Quest x Change Subtext Entry To y
  - Replace 'x' with the Quest ID you want to modify the subtext of. Replace
  'y' with the subtext entry ID you wish to change the quest to. This will
  make the subtext, when viewed in-game in the quest journal, to display the
  subtext entry ID 'y' found in the plugin parameters for quest 'x'. This is
  used for times you wish to update the subtext text midway through a quest.

Instructions - Lunatic Mode
============================================================================

The plugin parameter 'Lunatic Mode' is made for users who are familiar with
JavaScript. These parameters allow you to add additional lines of code to
their respective functions whenever the respective quest journal function
occurs in-game. The timing for them will occur after the function occurred
and only if it was successful in delivering a change.

There are a few rules to note. The code for each of those plugin functions
will only run if it meets these rules:

  1. The code will run for each quest or quest property changed. This means
     that if you used a plugin command that alters a group of quests or
     quest properties at once, the code will run multiple times individually
     for each quest or quest property.

  2. The code will only run if there has been successful changes to a quest
     or quest property. For example, if a quest is already set to 'Failed',
     running the plugin command to fail that quest again will not trigger
     the Lunatic Mode code to run again.

  3. When a quest is first added, any default properties added to the quest
     will not trigger the Lunatic Mode to run. For example, if the quest
     being added has objectives 1 and 2 already visible from the start, then
     the Lunatic Mode code will not run for 1 and 2.

Make sure you understand these rules so that you know what governs whether
or not the custom code runs.
